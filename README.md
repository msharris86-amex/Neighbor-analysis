# Neighbor-analysis


**Key Recommendations**
1. Focus on top 5 search positions - Do some SEO for better positions in search results.
2. Optimize for relevance sorting - Ratings are more important than winning out in price. Do not skimp on the little things to save money. 
3. Target September for campaigns - there is a lull in the summer followed by a peak in Q3. Target Campaigns during this time.

**Additional data to strengthen analysis**
-revenue/profit from each reservation to determine where to focus
-actual ratings on the listings
-actual price on the listing 
-session length on the views, how long is the user spending on each step
-host data- do they have ratings? mulitle listings? 
-User demographic data for profiling
-user lifetime value - repeat bookers
-when making a reservation when do we have people drop off in the process?
-any competitor data. Do our conversion rates stack up to theirs?
-Meta Data like a data dictionary that explained all the Variables
